Problem 1: Wallets

Write a Python program that request a user to provide numbers representing the value in cash for different wallets. Your program should store these values in a list. The user should be able to add as many values as they want. One example of a filled `wallets` list (in this example, with 5 wallets) would be:

```
print(wallets)

Output: [1023, 984, 192, 1842, 12]
```

After the user adds the values for the wallets, your application should provide the following information:
* The fattest wallet has `$value` in it.
* The skinniest wallet has `$value` in it.
* All together, these wallets have `$value` in them.
* All together, the total value of these wallets is worth `$value` dimes.

Please try to think about different functions to complete your work.

## Periodic Table 

The Periodic Table of the Elements was developed to organize information about the elements that make up the Universe.
Write a terminal application that lets you enter information about each element in the periodic table.
Make sure you include the following information:
* symbol, name, atomic number, row, and column

You must save the elements in a dictionary where the `symbol` is the key and the other attributes are nested inside `symbol`. The nested keys are `name`, `number`, `row`, `column`.

To populate your dictionary with data, provide a menu of options to the users:

1. Search the element by symbol (see all the details).
```
```
3. Search by a property (`name`, `number`, `row`, `column`) and see the values for that property for all the elements in the table.
4. Enter a new element manually (type the information for each property)
5. Change the properties of an element (by symbol)
6. Export periodic table as a JSON file
7. Load periodic table from JSON file
8. Exit the program

Make sure you do the appropriate communication with the user to get the necessary information to complete each step.
